                <h2>Planning</h2><br>
                <p>First, I created a rough mock up of what the final result would look like. 
                    Coding to requirements is a lot easier than making it up as you go.
                    For this project, I had three main goals:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice HTML, CSS, and using JavaScript to add functionality to webpages</li>
                    <li>Create something that generates an API call (wasn't taught in college)</li>
                    <li>Add something to my GitHub account that I can work on and display publicly</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Pretty soon I came up with WeatherWear: a simple website that takes care of all three goals.
                Next came the project requirements, which I wanted to keep simple and free. Here's how I did that:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual Studio Code - free, quality code editor with Live Server & other helpful extensions available</li>
                    <li>GitHub - great tool and free static webpage hosting</li>
                    <li>OpenWeather API - there is a free version that grants limited calls and data</li>
                    <li>The Internet - unlimited code examples and documentation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="rightCol">
                <div class="centerVertical">
                    <img src="images/brainstorm.PNG" alt="A brainstorming diagram" id="brainstormImg" style="width: 80%;">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row"> <!--HTML row-->
            <div class="leftCol">
                <div class="centerVertical">
                    <img src="images/htmlSample.PNG" alt="A brainstorming diagram" id="brainstormImg" style="width: 80%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="rightCol">
                <h2>HTML</h2><br>
                <p>The HTML code I started with was very basic. The majority of the content is arranged in left and right halves
                    of each horizontal area on the page. I created a div for each half inside the div for each bar. As
                     the project progressed, I added the images and text you see now.
                </p><br>
                <p>I added a simple nav bar at the top using basic HTML buttons to give the website more functionality, and a footer 
                    to deny credit for the images I used and stamp my name on it. Together these parts of the document push 
                    the project out of "baby's first HTML file" territory and into "relatively inexperienced coder" territory. 
                </p>

        <div class="row"> <!--CSS row-->
            <div class="leftCol">
                <h2>CSS</h2><br>
                <p>I created some custom tings
