                <h2>Planning</h2><br>
                <p>First, I created a rough mock up of what the final result would look like. 
                    Coding to requirements is a lot easier than making it up as you go.
                    For this project, I had three main goals:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice HTML, CSS, and using JavaScript to add functionality to webpages</li>
                    <li>Create something that generates an API call (wasn't taught in college)</li>
                    <li>Add something to my GitHub account that I can work on and display publicly</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Pretty soon I came up with WeatherWear: a simple website that takes care of all three goals.
                Next came the project requirements, which I wanted to keep simple and free. Here's how I did that:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual Studio Code - free, quality code editor with Live Server & other helpful extensions available</li>
                    <li>GitHub - great tool and free static webpage hosting</li>
                    <li>OpenWeather API - there is a free version that grants limited calls and data</li>
                    <li>The Internet - unlimited code examples and documentation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="rightCol">
                <div class="centerVertical">
                    <img src="images/brainstorm.PNG" alt="A brainstorming diagram" id="brainstormImg" style="width: 80%;">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row"> <!--HTML row-->
            <div class="leftCol">
                <div class="centerVertical">
                    <img src="images/htmlSample.PNG" alt="A brainstorming diagram" id="brainstormImg" style="width: 80%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="rightCol">
                <h2>HTML</h2><br>
                <p>The HTML code I started with was very basic. The majority of the content is arranged in left and right halves
                    of each horizontal area on the page. I created a div for each half inside the div for each bar. As
                     the project progressed, I added the images and text you see now. 
                    <br><br>
                    I added a simple nav bar at the top using basic HTML buttons to give the website more functionality, and a footer 
                    to deny credit for the images I used and to stamp my name on the site. While they are basic, these additions  
                    demonstrate attention to structure and provide navigability for future scaling.
                    <br><br>
                     Keeping the layout simple and easy to understand was important to this project. I limited user input to one 
                     field, and placed it at the top of the page. Because of this, users should be able to easily spot the input 
                     field. I kept the remaining portion of the site simple as well, using the same left-to-right 
                      "item followed by description" scheme for the main content of the page. After entering one value, users 
                      are given all the information they need on one page without any other required interactions.
                </p>

        <div class="row"> <!--CSS row-->
            <div class="leftCol">
                <h2>CSS</h2><br>
                <p>I wanted to keep the CSS relatively simple, but not so simple that it looks like the CSS failed to load.
                    I added a personal touch using relatively few and non-complex elements:
                </p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>added style while maintaining simplicity using only HTML color gradients and 3 main colors</li>
                    <li>made the buttons respond to being hovered or selected to provide feedback and responsiveness</li>
                    <li>uniform font that makes the website feel cohesive (aside from the nav buttons - Courier reminds me of my first coding class)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="rightCol">
                <div class="centerVertical">
                    <img src="images/cssSample.PNG" alt="A snippet of my CSS code" id="cssImg" style="width: 80%;">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row"> <!--Result row-->
            <div class="leftCol">
                <div class="centerVertical">
                    <img src="images/pageSnip.PNG" alt="A snippet of my CSS code" id="cssImg" style="width: 80%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="rightCol">
                <h2>The Result</h2><br>
                <p>
                    This website won't be winning a Nobel prize. With that being said, I did accomplish my three primary goals:
                </p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Use an API </li>
                    <li>Add a public project to my GitHub </li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    In addition to accomplishing my primary goals, I now have something of my own that serves as a web development sandbox. 
                    Equally important, it's public; it lets me share my passion projects with my friends and lets me show future 
                    colleagues/employers that I'm practicing and adding new skills to my repertoire.
